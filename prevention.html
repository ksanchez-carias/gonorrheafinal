          <h2>Prevention of Gonorrhea</h2>
          <div class="tell">
            <p>Gonorrhea is a preventable infection that someone can contract. For example, people can make sure that they are using a latex condom while having sexual intercourse to prevent STIs/ STDs to spread. To continue, they should get tested regularly to make sure they are clean. People should not only just encourage themselves to go but make their friends and their significant others go as well. One last thing that can be done to prevent getting Gonorrhea would be to avoid casual sex. Casual sex does not go anywhere and ends up getting messier than it has to be.</p>
