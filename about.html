                <p>I am Brandon Hines I am a young male from Philadelphia PA. I go to G.W. Carver High School of Engineering and
                    Science and I am heading into the 10th grade. At Carver each freshman is put into a health class. This health
                    class teaches us about things that our parents and other adults shielded us from as children. They taught
                    us about the various types of STDs and STIs and how to avoid contracting them. One that stood out to me was
                    gonorrhea since it wasn’t as bad as aids and was curable but still definitely something you wanted to avoid
                    getting. Since I’ve always kept that interest in the back of my mind I know that my groups project will succeed
                    since we are working on something that’s known to the public and is an actual problem in our society.</p>

             <p>JOY and HARD WORK. I consider one of my greatest accomplishments to be getting into Philadelphia High School for Girls with a 3.98 GPA, so you see that I am willing and able to work hard. My Algebra 1 teacher explained things really well and made the class fun, so you see that  I recognize the value of a good teacher. This summer I was accepted into SMASH@Wharton where I am studying six subjects while collaborating on a team project about a communicable disease and enjoying the opportunity to work hard and learn new things.</p>

              <p>SMASH@Wharton! An ivy league school is hosting this summer STEM academy operated by Level The Playing Field. During the 2017-2018 school year, I was recommended for this elite STEM program. Through my hard work, I was lucky enough to be selected out of hundreds of other students. I am currently one of the 35 students. The program is very educational and fun. It involves Biology, Mathematics, Design Thinking, Computer Science, Economics and Marketing courses, however we also have workshops that demonstrate skills that we can use in our everyday life. This program is filled with amazing teachers and multiple opportunities to create connections.</p>

                <p> SMASH@Wharton scholar, Danny Zhang, exemplifies social justice and esprit de corps on campus while also modeling the highest
                    academic standards in the classroom. “I love to make people feel like they’re worth something and make them feel
                    like family when they’re around me. I treat everyone with respect and they’re all my brothers and sisters.” Danny
                    particularly enjoys peer learning, “I enjoy learning and being able to spread my knowledge to other people. It makes
                    me smile to see others learn from me because it comes to show that I’m able to learn and they’re able to learn while
                    I teach.”</p>
