              <h2>History of Gonorrhea</h2>
            <p>The bacterium, Nesseria Gonorrhoeae or Gonorrhea was first discovered in 1879 by Albert Neisser. This strain of bacteria was nammed after him, Nesseria and Neisser. This bacteria was first brought European Settlers and explorers. It is said that Gonorrhea got its nickname from the french term “clapier” which means brothel. During this time period brothels was a source for Gonorrhea to be widely spread at a fast rate. Gonorrhea was spreading so extensively was because sailors would infect others with the bacteria. The treatment was getting a mercury shot on the tip of the penis, however that soon changed when penicillin was discovered. </p>
